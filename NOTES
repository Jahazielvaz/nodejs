TESTING YOUR WORK:
  node fileName (don't need to add extension)

REQUIRE:
  require("./fileName")
MODULE.EXPORTS:

  function animals(arra){
    return "there are " + arra.length + " elements in this array";
  }

  module.exports = animals;

  function adder = function(a, b){
  return `The sum of the 2 numbers is ${a + b}`;
  };

  var pi = 3.142;

////////////////////////
MODULE PATTERNS: Keep in mind that module.exports is just an empty object. Which
means that we can add properties to this object
  EXAMPLE:
    module.exports.propertyName = propertyValue;
    module.exports.animals = animals; (The value being the function you want to export)
This all means that you can add multiple exports by just creating properties for them.
  EXAMPLE:
    module.exports.animals = animals;
    module.exports.adder = adder;
    module.exports.pi = pi;
Another way, we could do this is by simply adding module.exports to the variable we're creating
  EXAMPLE:
    module.exports.counter = function(arr){
    return "There are " + arr.length + " elements in this array";
    };
We can also use object literal notation.
  EXAMPLE:
    module.exports = {
    counter : counter,
    adder : adder,
    pi : pi
    };




//////////////////////////////
THE  EVENT MODULE: Node JS comes with built in core modules, which we can also require the same way our custom modules work.
One of these core modules is the event module.
  EXAMPLE:
    require("events");
EVENTS EMITER: Just like all other modules, it returns whatever functionality comes with it. One of the things returned by this module is the events emitter.
  We can use the events emitter in node js to create custom events, and react to those events whenever they are emitted.
  In normal js, there's a list of events that we can access such as the click or mouseover event, but in node we can actually create the events themselves as well.
  NOTE: The events emitter is a constructor.
    SYNTAX:
      var myEmitter = new events.eventEmitter();

      Now we can wire-rope events to myEmitter.
        EXAMPLE:
          myEmitter.on("eventWeWant");
      Now we have defined the name of the event we wish to create. Now it's time to fire the event. After emit, we can select which event we want to fire,
      which in this case is going to be eventWeWant.
        EXAMPLE:
          myEmitter.emit("eventWeWant" "The event was emitted");

        The first argument in the emit function is the event we want to emit, and the arguments thereafter, are whatever we pass through the anonymous function.
        In other words, the parameters we chose to pass.

CORE MODULE UTIL: Stands for utility. It has vast functionality, but one of the things it does, is it allows you to inherit certain things from objects built into node js and other objects.
This is particularly good if you're trying to inherit a module inside a carConstructor.
  SYNTAX:
    var events = require("events");
    var util = require("util");

    var Person = function(name){
    this.name = name;
    }

    DEFAULT EXAMPLE: util.inherits("ConstructorName, desiredModule")
    APPLICATION EXAMPLE: util.inherits("Person", events.EventEmitter)


/////////////////////////////
CORE MODULE FS(For reading and writing files on our computer): FS can do a lot, but in this tutorial they only talk about the reading and writing parts of it. Need to study the other stuff later.
READING AND WRITING FILES SYNCHRONOUSLY
  READING:
    SYNTAX: 2 parameters. The first one takes in the file name. The second one takes in the character encoding.
    var fs = require("fs");
    fs.readFileSync():

    The above method will go out there and read the file for you. NOTE: THIS IS SYNCHRONOUS. It won't run anything until it finishes reading.
    This method takes in 2 parameters. The first one is the file name. The second one is the Character encoding(We're dealing with binary data. The encoding will break down all those zeros and ones. One example of Character encoding is utf8)
      EXAMPLE:
        fs.readFileSync("sample.txt", "utf8");

        var sample = fs.readFileSync("sample.txt", "utf8");
        console.log(sample);

        The above code will read the file to you in the console.

  WRITTING: 2 Parameters: The First parameter specifies where you want this file written to. The second parameter is the data we want to write in the file(which could be the name of another file stored in a variable)
    SYNTAX:
      fs.writeFileSync("sample2.txt", "sample.txt"); NOTE: The file first have to be read in order for fs to be able tow rite it.

READING AND WRITING FILES ASYNCHRONOUSLY.
  READING: 3 Parameters: The first 2 are the same as readFileSync. The third one takes in a callback function, in order for it to fire synchronously.
    CALLBACK PARAMETERS: The function will take two parameters. The first one will take in an err, in case there is one. The second will take the data that we retrieve.
    SYNTAX:
      fs.readFile("fileName.txt", "utf8", function(err, data){
        console.log(data);
      });

  WRITTING: Just like in the sync methods, the file first has to be read in order for it to be written, which means, you can write the file inside the readFile curly braces of the read section.
    2 PARAMETERS: The first one is the file name and the second one is the you want to write, but since you're putting inside the read function, you can just put the self defined parameter data, and it'll write the read data.
    EXAMPLE:
      fs.readFile("fileName.txt", "utf8", function(err, data){
        writeFile("newFileName.txt", data);
      });

  DELETING FILES: 1 Parameter: Passing the name of the file we wish to delete.
    EXAMPLE:
      fs.unlink(sample.txt);

  CREATING AND REMOVE DIRECTORIES:
    CREATING AND REMOVING SYNC
      CREATING: 1 Parameter: We just pass in the directory name.
        SYNTAX:
          fs.mkdirSync("folderName")
      DELETING: Same as creating except you use rmdir.
        SYNTAX:
          fs.rmdirSync("folderName");

    CREATING AND REMOVING ASYNC
      CREATING: We can do something within it's curly braces, like read a file.
        EXAMPLE:
          fs.mkdir("newDirectoryName", function(){
            fs.readFile("readMe.txt", "utf", function(err, data){
              fs.writeFile("./newDirectoryName/writeMe.txt", data)
            })
          })

      REMOVING: Note make sure you first empty the directory, otherwise it can't remove it. See the example below.
        EXAMPLE:
          fs.unlink("./ImAwesome/ofCourseYouAre.vicious", function(){
            fs.rmdir("ImAwesome");
          })


/////////////////////////////////
//// CLIENT AND SERVER REQUESTS AND RESPONSES
  PROTOCOLS: A set of communication rules, that two sides agree to use when communicating.

  IP ADDRESSES: Both computers and servers have their own IP addresses.

  HOW CLIENTS CONNECT TO SERVERS: The client first has to connect to the server's IP address. This is
  going to open what's known as a SOCKET between the two computers.

  SOCKET: It's basically a line of communication between 2 computers(think of it like a phone line that connects 2 phones.)
    It's basically just a channel through which information can be sent.
    And the information that is sent is structured via different protocols. For example http, or ftp. These protocols are like different languages, like german and italian.
    So they could choose which protocol or language to communicate in, and each language is structured differently. Depending on what the client and the server is trying to
    communicate with each other, we use a different protocol to structure the data or the information being sent.
      FTP: Stands for FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL. And it's made for that purpose.
      HTTP: Is used for websites.
    When the structure of the information that's being sent has been decided. the information is then sent down the socket between the 2 computers via a protocol called TCP
      TCP: This is the socket protocol. This is the actual way that it's sent to the server or the client.
       TCP splits the data into small little chunks, and transfers them along the socket. These small little sections are called PACKETS.
      PACKETS: The small little chunks of data being sent via socket.

  NODE JS: All of the above functionality is built within our computer, and node gives us the ability to access this functionality.
    To output a connection between two computers, and send information between them.
    If we run Node JS in the server; we can tell node what information we want to send out to clients. How to do this is in the very next lesson.
    Next Tutorial we're going to create a server, and we're going to respond to requests made by the client.

  PORTS: When we send a request to a server, which node js is living in, how do we know that the request is meant for node js itself, and not some other program which is also
  running on the server instead, like an Email program for example. How do we know that we want Node JS to deal with that particular request.
    ANSWER: Node JS and all other programs running on the server, listen to a particular port number.
      So if a request is being sent to a particular IP address, to a particular port number on that IP. If node JS, is listening out for requests, on that port, it will respond.
      Otherwise it wont. That's how we root our requests to node JS
        EXAMPLE:
          172.24.35.76:3000
          In this example above, the numbers all the way up to the colon, makeup the IP address. The :3000 after the IP address is the port number(Keep in mind that you can change this port number)
          So on this computer could live a variety of programs, and if node JS is listening to that particular port 3000, and a request was sent to this port :3000, then node is going to send a response.

//////////////////////////////////
////// CREATING A SERVER
GOALS FOR THIS TUTORIAL
1- MAKE A SERVER.
2- GO IN THE BROWSER AND MAKE A REQUEST TO THAT SERVER.
3- DEAL WITH THAT REQUEST IN NODE JS.

MAKING THE SERVE: Use Node JS's core module called the http module. Then we can use a method given to us by http, called createServer(); and this creates a server.
  SYNTAX:
    var http = require("http");
    var server = http.createServer();

  The server has now been created but it currently can't do anything with the requests it receives. In order for us to set up the functionality, we need to pass a function with 2 parameters
  req(Stands for request), and res(Stands for response)
    EXAMPLE:
        var server = http.createServer(req, res){

        };

        Whenever we send a request to this server, then the function is going to fire.
        REQ: The request object comes loaded with details about the request that has been made.
        RES: The response object is something we can use to send a response back to the client.

  RESPONSE HEADERS: When we make a request to a server, and when we respond. As well as responding
    with some data, or information, we also respond with headers, and on the request we can send request headers.
    Think of headers as extra information about the request or the response: Much like in HTML you have a head section
    which tells the browser a little more information about the page, but it's not actually shown on the browser.
    Headers are similar.

    THINGS WE CAN PUT IN THE HEADER:
      -Content-Type: So the browser knows what to expect. Whether that's going to be plain text, or html or Json, because it's going to deal with each one in a different way,
        For example: It renders html on a page, in a browser. It doesn't do that with plain text. With Content Type, we're telling the browser about the content.
      -Status: We can put a status in the response header. Something like 200 which means everything was ok, or 404 if the page couldn't be found.

      RESPONSE HEADERS SYNTAX: First parameter is the status. Second We'll pass in an object, and in it we'll do the Content-Type(Note: the caps matter). And the value of the content type which could be html plain json, etc
      var server = http.createServer(req, res){
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type" : "text/plain"});
      };

      Next thing we want to do is end this response and send it to the browser, and to do that we can use a method called end in the response object. In the parenthesis, we could send back some information or data.
        EXAMPLE:
        var server = http.createServer(req, res){
          res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type" : "text/plain"});
          res.end("My awesome response!");
        };

      SETTING UP A PORT: So now we need to set up a port for node to listen to for requests. We can use .listen, and choose the port number we want. And the IP address(Which will be the local host if you'r running a local server)
      NOTE: req.url is a built in property we can access on the req object, which tells us the name of the url that's sending the request.
        SYNTAX:
          var server = http.createServer(req, res){
            console.log("Request was made: " + req.url)
            res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type" : "text/plain"});
            res.end("My awesome response!");
          };


          server.listen(3000, "127.0.0.1"); NOTE: You can also run localhost since it's just a local server.


////////////////////////////////////
/////// STREAMS AND BUFFERS:
BUFFER: Is a temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another.
  The buffer is filled with data, then passed along.
  Transfer small chunks of data at a time.

STREAM: A stream of data that flows overtime from one place to another. The stream feeds into the buffer which collects a small chunk of data together. Then when the buffer is full, it passes that chunk of data down the stream and is sent to the client.
  EXAMPLE:
    Streaming movies online. This is buffers and streams in action. We have the movie which is all the data we need to transfer since you want to watch it all, but we don't want to wait for all of that movie data to be sent in one shot for us to start watching it.
    We just wait for these chunks of data to arrive, and we can start watching as they arrive. We can consume data bit by bit.

    We can create streams to read and write files in node js, which because of the way streams and buffers work. Can increase the performance of your application, and that's also true when we're dealing with requests on our node server, and we're sending data back
    to the client to be consumed. This all ties in together.

STREAMS SPECIFICS:
  -Writable streams: allow node js to write data to a stream.
  -Readable streams: Allow node js to read data from a stream.
  -Duplex: Can read and write to a stream.

  MORE DETAILS:
    WRITTABLE STREAMS: When we're sending a response to a client for node js. We are sending the client some data. So in this instance we are talking about a writable stream, because we're writing data to the stream.
    READABLE STREAMS: If node was receiving data from somewhere like reading a file, or receiving a request, then this would be considered a readable stream, because it would be reading data coming from another stream.
      We need to specify which file we want to read through the stream. We first need to use the __dirname property, and that's going to give us the current directory, and we then concactanate the file name.

      READ STREAM EXAMPLE:
        var fs = require("fs");

        var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/desiredFileName.txt'); NOTE: You need the / in order for it to work, because you're using the __dirname to specify your current directory and the / tells it that you want a file that's in that particular directory.

        So now this stream is going to fill up the buffer, and that buffer is going to pass the data in chunks.

        IMPORTANT: The createReadStream inherits from the event emitter.
          THERE'S ALSO A PRESET EVENT CALLED DATA. On the createReadStream: Which allows us to listen for when we receive any kind of data, or chunk.

            EXAMPLE:
              myReadStream.on("data", function(chunk){
                console.log("New Chunk of Data");
                console.log(chunk);
              })

              So now myReadStream is listening for data. As data passes the "data" event name fires the function, and since it's already listening for data, the parameter chunk(You can name it anything you want) is equal to the value of the data being received, or in other words, the data
              we get will be stored in the chunk parameter. So now we can choose where we want node to read this data, which in this case it's going to be on the console.

              NOTE: If we send the information like that, we're just going to get the buffer codes, but the content won't be translated to match the actual data inside, and that's because we haven't specified the character encoding. If we want the data to be displayed correctly, we need to specify
                The character encoding.
                  EXAMPLE:
                    var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/desiredFileName.txt', 'utf8');
                    myReadStream.on("data", function(chunk){
                      console.log("New Chunk of Data");
                      console.log(chunk);
                    })

                So now, we can receive chunks of data, and pass it onto the user through a writable stream which we'll see in the next tutorial.

      WRITABLE STREAMS: This requires where you want the file the write the info, and the file name as the parameters.
        In order for you to actually write the content that your server is reading, you need to use the built in write() method.
        SYNTAX
          var myWriteStream = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + 'writeMe.txt');

          var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + 'readMe.txt', function(chunk){
            console.log('New Chunk');
            myWriteStream.write(chunk);
          })

/////////////////////////////
PIPES: This is a shorter more elegant method for reading and writing streams than the previous one. We don't have to manually listen for data events, and we don't have to manually write to a write stream. This takes care of all that for us.
  We still need to write the read stream, and the write stream. The change happens in the listener for data. We'll use the pipe method(We can only use this method on a read stream);
    EXAMPLE:
      var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname, '/myFile.txt', 'utf8');
      var myWriteStream = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname, '/myNewFile.txt');

      myReadStream.pipe(myWriteStream);


  WRITING TO A CLIENT!!: You need to create your server, and put the readStream inside the server function, so that you can use the built in req and res properties. Inside the readStream.pipe() instead of putting a file name, you need to put res so it could send it to the response. because the res
    property, is a writable stream.
      EXAMPLE:
        var http = require('http');
        var fs = require('fs');

        var server = http.creatServer(function(req, res){
        console.log('request has been made by: ', req.url);
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type' : 'text/html'});
        var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/index.html', 'utf8');
        myReadStream.pipe(res);
        });

        server.listen(5000);
        console.log('server now running');

    SERVING UP AN HTML FILE:
      It's exactly the same as the code above, except that you need to specify in the content type that it's an html file, and write it(Note that this is not going to serve up your detached css or js files that go with your html. You need other stuff for that.);

    SERVING JSON: Content-Type needs to be specified as: application/json.
      In order to actually create the Json data chunk, you can just create an object literal, and include that data in the res.end().
      IMPORTANT!: Your end point only takes in a string or a buffer, so we need serialize it. We need to create it into a string, and that string has to be in Json format.
        var objectName = {
        name: 'Josh',
        job: 'Ninja',
        age 38
        }
          SYNTAX: JSON.stringify(objectName)

        API ENDPOINT: Javascript can make this kind of request. This is pretty much an api endpoint that js can make a call to.
          EXAMPLE:
            mywebsite.com/api/objectName (The way we'd set this up would be through routing which we'll learn more about in future tutorials.);

//////////////////////////
BASIC ROUTING: You can set up what routes you want the information to be sent to using if else statements.
  EXAMPLE:
    var http = require('http');
    var fs = require('fs');

    var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
      console.log('Request has been made: ' + req.url);
      if(req.url === '/home' || req.url '/'){
      res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
      fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/index.html').pipe(res);
      }
    })

    You can set up multiple routes using if else statements. Here's an example of multiple page routes
      EXAMPLE:
        var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
          console.log('Request has been made: ' + req.url);
          if(req.url === '/home' || req.url === '/'){
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/craze.html', 'utf8').pipe(res);
          } else if(req.url === '/contact'){
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/contact.html', 'utf8').pipe(res);
          } else if (req.url === '/about'){
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
            fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/about.html', 'utf8').pipe(res);
          } else {
            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
            res.end('PAGE NOT FOUND');
          }
        })

        server.listen(4000);
        console.log('Server running....');

//////////////////////////////
EXPRESS:
  -Easy and flexible routing system.
  -Integrates with many templating engines
  -Contains a middleware framework

  HTTP METHODS/VERBS: They're essentially the kind of request we make.
    Each different type of request contains a specific piece of information attached to it, to say to the server what kind of request it is, then it's up to the server
    to look at what type of request it is, and then treat that type of request in a particular way. By using express in node, we can respond to each of these different types
    of requests very easily. We do it by using the methods that express provides us with.
    -GET: This is the type of request we make when we type in a url in an address bar.
      express: app.get('route', function);
    -POST: Generally made when we're posting data to a server for say a webform.
      express: app.post('route', function);
    -DELETE:
      express: app.delete('route', function)
    -PUT

    download: npm install express -save (So that you can save it as a dependency);

    SYNTAX: We first require it, and then we set up what's known as an express app. example below. Through calling this built in express function, we get access to all of
    expresses functionality everytime we call upon it. We also need to listen to a port.

    REQ AND RES: Express also uses these properties, but express has extended these properties to have more functionality.
      Express is smart enough to know what content type we're using so we don't need to specify it.

      var express = require('express');
      var app = express();

      app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.send('This is the homepage');
      })

      app.listen(4555);


--------------
EXPRESS ROUTE PARAMETERS: We can actually set up parameters for different routes so we don't have to write a method for each and every single page.
  The way you set up a parameter, is by using the semicolon : as a path, and then you concactenate it or use it with .notation
    EXAMPLE:
    app.get('/profile/:id', function(req, res){
      res.send('You requested to see a profile with the id of' + req.params.id);
    });

    NOTE: from my trials after the : you can name it anything, you just have to call the same name in .notation.


----------------
TEMPLATING ENGINES: If you want to send an html file, you can use the method sendFile(), with the absolute path to the file you wish to send.
  Template engines allow us to embed data in js code into our html files. There's a variety of different engines we can use(Make sure you research them later so you can use it like a boss.);
  EJS: This is a lightweight template engine making it really easy to get started with.

  EXAMPLE:
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
    })

  ATTACHING DYNAMIC CONTENT TO THE PAGES WE SEND:
    EJS: We use the $ to tell it that we plan to use EJS.

    1- Install EJS(It's a package)
    2- Tell express that we want to use EJS as our view engine: app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
        The first parameter we specify what we want to set which in this case is the view engine, and the second one, we tell it the name of the software, which in this case it's ejs.
        By default, when we request some views or templates, it's going to look in the /views foldert for them. That's the default behavior.
    3- Create a views directory.
    4- Create a new template file: new file views\fileName.ejs. The extension tells express that this is an ejs template.
        We can do exactly the same as we can do in an html file, but now we can embed javascript and data in it.
    5- Route your ejs file: We'll use render() instead of send file. We don't need to pass through the file path, because render knows to look in the view folder.
        EXAMPLE:
          app.get('/profile/:name', function(req, res){
            res.render('profile');
          })

        app.listen(3000);

---------------------
TEMPLATING ENGINES PART 2:
  OUTPUTTING DATA: We're able to pass some JS as well as other code, not just standard data.
    The output for outputting data is the same for code as it is for outputting data, the only difference is that with code, you don't include the equal sign.
      EXAMPLE:
        Data: <%= info %>
        Code: <% code %>

------------------------
PARTIAL VIEWS: You can create partial views which means mini templates that you can include in as many as your views as you want. This is really useful so you don't have to write the same code over and over. For example: You can write a partial header, which you can include in all your files. This is also useful, if you wanted to make updates, because if you make an update to a partial, it'll update it on all the pages that contain that partial.
  1-Create a partials directory, inside the views directory.
  2-Create the partial fileName.ejs we wish to name it.
  3-Write the html code you wish to write in the created partial file.
  4-Use an include statement with the path of the partial view inside the ejs tags <% %>
    EXAMPLE:
      <% include partials/nav.ejs %>

--------------------------
MIDDLEWARE AND STATIC FILES
  EXTERNAL FILES: Your external files such as css or javascript automatically transfer to the linked html or ejs file. They're like any other page in node. They're making a request to the server as well, and the request is not coming through because we haven't specified it to do so.

  REQUESTS FOR STATIC FILES: While we're dealing with different url requests, we're not dealing with static file requests. If we had to create urls for all the static files, it would quickly get out of hand. There's a simple way to serve all the static files. That's one of the purposes of middleware. Express comes with built in middleware we can use.
    MIDDLEWARE: Middleware is essentially the code that runs between the request and the response. All the code between the request and the response is middleware. We're going to use to custom middleware(Built in middleware).
      app.use(): With this built in method we can use some middleware, and we can match it to our route if we want, or if we don't put routing, it's going to use this middleware on every request that is made, either in the browser or within the document.
        EXAMPLE:
          app.use('/assets', function(req, res, next){

          })

          NEXT PARAMETER: We use this parameter to say look, we've finished our middleware, now go on to the next set of middleware(if we have multiple middleware that matches a certain route.)
          for example, if we had this route ('/') that would match any url that the user writes in the address bar, when they're using our application. So when we run this middleware, we need a way
          to tell node js to go to the next middleware, or the next request/the next get method. What we need to do is, at the end of the middleware use this next();
            EXAMPLE:
              app.use('/', function(req, res, next)
                THIS IS WHERE WE WOULD INCLUDE OUR MIDDLEWARE.
                next();
              });

              if we don't put this next(); There, then potentially our future code is going to break and the application won't run.
          --------------------
          EXPRESSES CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE:
            SYNTAX:
              express.static()
              EXAMPLE:
                app.use('/assets', express.static())

                So now we need to map the above route /assets which contains the express.static functionality, to the assets folder which contains your static files.
                  EXAMPLE:
                    app.use('/assets', express.static(assets))

                    So now, any request that's made to /assets/somethingElse, is going to map to the assets folder and it's going to server up whatever we request.


---------------------------
QUERY STRINGS: Additional data, added on to an http request in the form of name value pairs.
  -? This is how you let node know that you intend to use a query string.
  -page = 2: This would go after the question mark. This would basically saying that it's targeting the second page of the news article.
    EXAMPLE:
      mysite.com/contact?person=ryu
  -MULTIPLE QUERY STRINGS: You can have as many query strings as you want. You just have to separate them by the &(ampersand)
    EXAMPLE:
      mysite.com/contact?person=ryu&dept=marketing
  -CREATING AN OBJECT FOR IT IN RENDER:
    EXAMPLE:
      {nameItWhatYouWant: req.query} So the req.query, is going to listen for when query strings are called.
  -CALLING QUERY STRINGS:
    EXAMPLE:
      <%= chosenObjectName.propertyYouWantToAccess %> This is just for text
      <% This is for code snippets %>
